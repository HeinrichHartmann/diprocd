The code here is coming directly from the Ganeti project.

You will find the usual 2 space Python indentation coming from the
Google in-house coding standard.

If you find something crappy in the code, this is most likely
something I added and you must not assume it is coming from the Ganeti
project. If you find something good, you can assume it comes from the
Ganeti project.

Changes for diprocd: Renamed the imports to use diprocd instead of ganeti.
