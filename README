# diprocd 

`diprocd` is the DIstributed PROcess Control Daemon. It takes care of
managing your processes for you over several nodes with a single point
of control.

It is composed of 3 components:

- the worker `dpd-workerd`: a traditional process supervisor but
  simpler as using a single json file to define all the processes;
- the master `dpd-masterd`: the central manager, it reads a single
  json configuration file and publish for each client on each node
  the new list of processes to supervise;
- the client `dpd-clientd`: it subscribes to the updates from
  `dpd-masterd` and update the configuration file of
  `dpd-workerd`. The worker automatically pick up the new
  configuration and start/stop/restart processes accordingly.

`diprocd` is robust and used in production.
